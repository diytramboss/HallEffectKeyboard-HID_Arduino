# HallEffectKeyboard-HID_Arduino
Source code for a hall effect osu keyboard using Arduino HID and SS49E Sensors.

HE KEYboards are Expensive, at least for me. osu! only needs 2 keys to play & 3 keys to use smoke/fast tapping. If you have access to a maker lab(or can ask someone to let you) you can just borrow a lot of the required components.
